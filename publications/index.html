      <blockquote>Humans often produce vocalizations for infants that differ from vocalizations for adults. Is this property common across societies? The forms of infant-directed vocalizations may be shaped by their function in parent-infant com- munication. If so, infant-directed song and speech should be differentiable from adult-directed song and speech on the basis of their acoustic features, and this property should be relatively invariant across cultures. To test this hypothesis, we built a corpus of 1,614 recordings of infant- and adult-directed singing and speech produced by 411 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies. We studied the corpus in a massive online experiment and in a series of acoustic analyses. Naïve listeners (N = 13,218) reliably identified infant-directed vocalizations as infant-directed, and adult-directed speech (but not songs) as adult-directed, at rates far higher than chance. Ratings of infant-directed song were the most accurate and the most consistent across all societies; infant-directed speech was accurately identified on average, but inconsistently across societies. To determine the mechanisms underlying these results, we extracted many acoustic features from each recording and identified those that most reliably characterize infant-directed song and speech across cultures, via preregistered exploratory-confirmatory analyses and machine classification. The features distinguishing infant- and adult-directed song and speech concerned pitch, rhythmic, phonetic, and timbral attributes; a hypothesis-free classifier with cross-validation across societies reliably identified all vocalization types, with highest accuracy for infant-directed song. Last, we isolated 12 acoustic features that were predictive of perceived infant-directedness; of these, two pitch attributes (median F0 and its variability) were by far the most explanatory. These findings demonstrate cross-cultural regularities in infant-directed vocalizations that are suggestive of universality; moreover, infant-directed song appears to be more cross-culturally stereotyped than infant-directed speech, informing hypotheses of the functions and evolution of both.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Music is a human universal [1–3] which, like nonhuman vocalizations [4,5], is characterized by acoustical forms that are predictive of its behavioral functions [1,6]. Adult listeners use this fact to accurately distinguish between unfamiliar lullabies and love songs [7], dance songs, and healing songs [6], and so on, on the basis of those songs’ musical features alone [1]. This could be attributable to adults’ extensive musical experience, however, as opposed to the basic design of the human mind. Here we show that American infants (N = 144) relax in response to lullabies from eight small-scale societies, relative to matched songs from other small-scale societies, as measured by heart rate and electrodermal activity. These results were consistent throughout the first year of life, suggesting the relaxation response is not a function of infants’ rich musical experiences [8–10]. Infants showed no visual preferences for the animated characters producing the songs, but they attended more to the lullabies, as evidenced by less blinking during the singing. Moreover, the infants’ parents chose foreign lullabies as the songs that they themselves would use to calm their fussy infant, much more often than other foreign songs. Together, these findings raise the possibility that links between form and function in music are innately specified, in contrast to features of music perception that are culturally determined [3,11].</blockquote>

      <blockquote>283 million people suffer from moderate to severe vision impairment or blindness; many today rely on lens-based optical aids of limited use. Electronic pass-through zoom headsets are extremely expensive and provide narrow feature sets with compromised comfort and ease-of-use, while mobile app-based aids provide useful functionality but in an inconvenient form factor. The present project explores the development of an aid for the visually impaired, designed as a software solution running on off-the-shelf optical see-through augmented reality head-mounted display devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens, to deliver a broad feature set while reducing cost and optimizing comfort and usability.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>What is universal about music, and what varies? We built a corpus of ethnographic text on musical behavior from a representative sample of the world’s societies, as well as a discography of audio recordings. The ethnographic corpus reveals that music (including songs with words) appears in every society observed; that music varies along three dimensions (formality, arousal, religiosity), more within societies than across them; and that music is associated with certain behavioral contexts such as infant care, healing, dance, and love. The discography—analyzed through machine summaries, amateur and expert listener ratings, and manual transcriptions—reveals that acoustic features of songs predict their primary behavioral context; that tonality is widespread, perhaps universal; that music varies in rhythmic and melodic complexity; and that elements of melodies and rhythms found worldwide follow power laws.</blockquote>
